Marmot Agent Client

- Hold Right Option/Alt to record -> send audio (or text input) to /connect
- Server records the user turn and runs the agent. The agent only produces output by calling speak().
- All Marmot speech is delivered via /poll (unified queue path for both replies and proactives).
- Client prints "You:", then receives Marmot output via poller, plays audio, copies to clipboard.
- Proactive (and reply) speech is gated by detect_human() when appropriate.

    Strategy:
    - We maintain a small local queue (pending_proactive_queue) for proactives that the
      server delivered (and already committed to conversation history) while we were busy.
    - Whenever we are in an idle window (not recording, not sending), we first try to
      drain one buffered proactive. The actual audio playback is still serialized by
      playback_lock, so it will wait for any in-progress speech to finish.
    - Only when the client is fully unblocked do we poll the server for *new* proactives.
    - This gives the "small queue for proactives that get blocked" behavior.
    - All proactive playback (fresh or buffered) is gated by detect_human() — we only
      speak server-initiated messages when the camera sees a person ("human"/"person" label
      from the YOLO server via /detect). If no one is there we defer and retry later.
    - After 5 minutes with no "user interaction" (record hotkey press or successful
      detect_human()), the poller and camera checks back off to approximately once per minute
      to avoid unnecessary work / camera use when the user is away.
