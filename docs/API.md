# Marmot API Reference

The Marmot server is a small Flask application (default port `5000`). You can override the port with the `MARMOT_PORT` environment variable.

## POST /connect

Input endpoint (voice or text). The server records the user turn and starts the agent.

**All AI-to-user communication now happens exclusively via the `speak` tool.** The model decides when (and whether) to speak. Spoken output is queued and delivered to the client via `/poll`.

**Input**

- `multipart/form-data` with `file=@recording.wav` → audio path (16 kHz mono WAV recommended)
- `application/json` body: `{ "text": "your question" }` → text-only path

**Response**

```json
{
  "transcription": "what the user said",
  "status": "processing"
}
```

- `transcription`: The recognized (or provided) user input.
- The actual AI response(s) (if any) will arrive later via the client's `/poll` mechanism when the agent calls `speak()`.
- If the agent does internal work but never calls `speak`, nothing will be played to the user.

## Other endpoints

- `GET /` — Simple self-contained status dashboard. Shows live health data, services, context/memory stats, live mind state (focus + activity), and the mascot image. Auto-refreshes every 5 seconds. Includes a one-click "Reset Context" button.
- `GET /health` — Returns server status, current context size, last message time, pending proactive count, detection server config, plus service models/voices. The dashboard consumes this endpoint.
- `POST /reset` — Clears the rolling conversation history (also extracts persistent memory before clearing).
- `GET /poll` — Internal endpoint used by the interactive client. Supports optional long-poll via `?wait=` (capped at 10s by the server).  
  Returns `{"action":"initiate","message":{...}}` when the server has a queued proactive message, or `{"action":"noop"}`.
- `POST /inject` — Manually queue a proactive (server-initiated) message.  
  Body example: `{ "text": "Hey, the build finished.", "speak": true }`  
  Useful for testing or from external scripts / future background logic.
- `POST /detect` — Accepts an image and returns a list of detected object labels (e.g. `{"objects": ["person", "laptop"]}`). Used by the client for camera-based human presence checks before speaking proactive messages. Requires an external YOLO detection server (configured via `DETECTION_BASE_URL`).

## POST /detect

Accepts an image (via multipart upload) and returns the object labels detected by a configured external YOLO-based image recognition server.

**Input**

- `multipart/form-data` with `image=@snapshot.jpg` **or** `file=@snapshot.jpg`

**Response**

```json
{
  "objects": ["person", "laptop", "chair"]
}
```

- Returns a flat list of class names (strings) as reported by the YOLO model (e.g. COCO classes: "person", "cat", "bottle", etc.).
- The interactive client calls this (after capturing a webcam frame) to decide whether to speak a proactive message. It considers a human present if `"person"` or `"human"` appears in the list.
- The Marmot server itself does not run YOLO — it proxies the image to the external detection server specified by `DETECTION_BASE_URL` (set during first-run setup or in `server/code/config.json`). If no detection server is configured, `/detect` returns an error.

### Server-initiated (proactive) messages

- When the interactive client is idle (not recording, not already speaking a response, not mid-request), its background poller will pick up queued messages via `/poll`.
- The proactive text is appended to the conversation context on the server (so follow-up hotkey responses continue the thread naturally).
- Audio is auto-played but **never overlaps** previous audio (playback is serialized on the client).
- If the client is busy (recording, in the middle of a response, or audio still playing) when a proactive arrives from the server, it is buffered in a small local queue (max 4) on the client and played automatically as soon as the client becomes unblocked. The server has already committed these messages to conversation context at delivery time.
- **Human presence gating**: Before speaking any proactive message (fresh or from the local buffer), the client captures a frame from the webcam and calls `POST /detect`. The message is only spoken if the result contains `"person"` or `"human"`. This prevents the agent from talking to an empty room. The client uses a cheap `/pending` check to avoid unnecessary camera work when the queue is empty.
- On the client, proactives are printed with a `(proactive)` label, copied to the clipboard, and spoken (when audio is present). Camera access (and `opencv-python`) is required on the client machine for the human-presence feature. The poller checks for messages frequently (every ~1s on local networks) for good responsiveness.

## Testing with curl

Here are handy `curl` commands for testing the server directly (especially useful during development or when the Python client isn't available).

**Health check**
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:5000/health | jq
```

**Send a text query** (recommended for quick tests)
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/connect \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "what is the current hostname and kernel version?"}' | jq
```

**Send text and print only the response** (clean output)
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/connect \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "list the top 5 processes by memory usage"}' | jq -r '.text'
```

**Send text and save the spoken audio reply**
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/connect \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "tell me a short joke about marmots"}' \
  | jq -r '.audio' | base64 -d > /tmp/marmot_reply.wav \
  && echo "Saved audio to /tmp/marmot_reply.wav"
```

**Send an audio file** (multipart upload). Reply arrives asynchronously via poll.
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/connect \
  -F "file=@/path/to/your/recording.wav" | jq
```

**Reset conversation context**
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/reset | jq
```

**Queue a proactive message (server initiates)**
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/inject \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "The long-running job you started earlier just completed successfully.", "speak": true}' | jq
```
The next time the interactive client is idle it will receive it via its `/poll` background loop, print it with a `(proactive)` label, copy to clipboard, and speak the audio (if TTS is enabled). The message is also recorded in the rolling conversation context.

**Check for humans/objects in an image (via the /detect endpoint)**
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/detect \
  -F "image=@/tmp/webcam.jpg" | jq
```

Returns something like `{"objects": ["person", "keyboard", "cup"]}`. The interactive client uses this internally (after grabbing a webcam frame) to decide whether to speak proactive messages. The server forwards the image to the external YOLO detection server configured at startup (`DETECTION_BASE_URL`).

> **Tip**: Replace `localhost:5000` with your server's address if it's running elsewhere.  
> `jq` is recommended for readable JSON (install with `sudo apt install jq` or equivalent).  
> Useful fields: `.transcription` (what the user said), `.status`.

Example:
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/connect \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "list files in ~"}' | jq '{transcription, status}'
```

## Background behavior and scheduling

There is no longer a static cron system for scheduling prompts.

The AI mind has a fully dynamic, self-managed attention system:

- Live `mind_state` (current focus, private observations, next planned wake) is injected into **every** prompt. Human replies are naturally influenced by whatever the mind is doing in the background.
- Autonomous mind loop wakes on its own schedule or when the AI calls `plan_next_wake(seconds, reason)`.
- The mind uses `set_focus()` and `log_observation()` to steer its own internal life.
- See the "Mind State" card on the dashboard and the `"mind"` object in `GET /health`.
- The mind can still produce proactive spoken messages via the `speak` tool (same path as before).

The old `cron.json` mechanism has been removed in favor of the mind controlling its own schedule.

See `server/code/server.py` (mind loop and state) and `prompts/system_prompt.txt` (autonomous mind instructions) for details.
